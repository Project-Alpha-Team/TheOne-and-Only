We used Eventful API to find information about a certian singer
we used music musixmatch to find the lyric of certian song ( hit song)
We used leaflet.js and open street maps to show the adress of event's venue ( we got this information via eventful)

ãƒ»Description: 
User can find events by artist, data, and location. After searching, the lyrics of artist's popular song, image of the event, and detail of the event will show up. User can also interact with the detail of the event such as the address of the event (the map api is called when user clicks the address).
